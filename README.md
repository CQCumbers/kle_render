# KLE-Render
Get prettier images of Keyboard Layout Editor designs

This project uses Pillow (Python Image Library), Flask, and Flask-RESTPlus to serve up 'renders' of keyboards from their keyboard layout editor JSON, by stretching, tinting, and tiling base images of a 1u keycap.

### TODO:
- Convert Character Picker glyphs to Unicode
- Add support for front-printed legends
- Add support for L-shaped keys
